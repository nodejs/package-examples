# Node.js package shipping patterns

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is currently under construction. It's meant to replace the sections in the Node.js package documentation for documenting package shipping patterns, the pros and cons, and guidelines for CJS to ESM migration.

A team is being formed to get this effort up and going! See [Issue #3](https://github.com/nodejs/package-examples/issues/3) for details.

⚒️ The package shipping guide is being worked on [here](./guide/) . See [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute to it.
For a quick overview of what the guide covers, see [guide/SUMMARY.md](./guide/SUMMARY.md).

The previous documents from package.md in the Node.js API documentation have been moved to [this chapter](./guide/07-dual-packages/README.md) for reference.
