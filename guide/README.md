# Introduction

This is a guide on how to configure a package for Node.js. We will cover the basics of package configuration, including how to structure your files, how to use the `package.json` file, and how to handle CommonJS and ECMAScript modules (ESM).

For each topic, we will provide examples and explanations to help you understand how to configure your package effectively. You can check out the [repository]() of this guide for the complete code examples.
